## Assignment 1 - Bank Service

This is done in Python3 so you should have it if you want to run it!

The way to run this project is by configuring the config file! The server_ip only affects the client as the server runs on `127.0.0.1` as default. The port affect both the client and server, so change that to whatever you want.
The `start_money` just defines how much a new account start with and `currency` is just what currency the money is in.

To try out the application I would create a new account this can be done with `create account` command in the client. After that you should use `connect` and enter in the newly created account handle that you get told what is when you create a new one. Here on you can run the help command and see what commands you can use.
